<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p>Looks like you have either requested to reset your password because you forgot it, or may be you have created a
    new account. This is the token that you need to use: <code>{{ token }}</code> use this token in the following
    JSON format to send it to <code>POST /user/new_password/&lt;reset_token&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
    {
        "new_password": "&lt;your_new_password&gt;"
    }
</code></pre>
